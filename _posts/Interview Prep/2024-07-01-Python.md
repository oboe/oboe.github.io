## Python Interpreter

- [ ] What is the python global interpreter lock?

## Basics

```
In interactive last printed expression is assigned to variable `_`

Theres no char type in python.

You ca slice with word[0:2] a->b(excluded)

strings are immutable, so you need to recreate them

use len(word) for strings

collections are called compound data types

list = [1,2,3,4]

simple assignment is by reference

print(a, end=',') to avoid newlines

```
## Control flow

```
dogs = {'bob':'corgi','jeff':'wolf'}
for key,val in dogs.copy().items():
	print("yay I'm iterating")

Your standard for loop!
for i in range(len(n)):
	print(i)

for a,b in enumerate(values):
	print(a,b)

range() looks like it creates a list but it ISNT! 
ITS AN iterable!
<https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable >

use pass to fill a unimplemented body.

DEFINING FUNCTIONS!
- executing a function adds a new symbol table for the local vars
- so all vars check the local symbol table, then the outer one, then global, then built-in ones.
- this means if you assign x=2 in a func, and a global x is defined it'll just create a new func in the function symbol table. You need to pull in the global one using `global x`
- The function parameters are actually added to the local symbol table of the called func, it's call by value!
- function definitions are also inserted in the relevant symbol table.
- functions always just return None

function defaults are only evaluated once, this accumulates values, mega JANK
def f(a,L=[]):
	L.append(a)
	return L

if you want to get arbitrary info through your python functions
- getting tuple `*arguments`
- getting dict `**keywords`

want to provide a func elements from a list? args = [1,2] then use range(*args). Same can be done with dicts.
```

## Data structures
```
List is actually a dynamic array.

deque exists

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
tada

use `del` to delete elemnts from a list by index

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq>
Sequences
1. Lists
2. Tuples
3. Ranges

sequence unpacking is possible yay!

here's a set() or second_set = {1,2,3}
Can also do set comprehensions, nice

and use dict() tada
- del mp[a]
- list(mp)
- sorted(mp)

<https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-can-t-i-use-an-assignment-in-an-expression>
while var := f(x):
	print(var)
Assignment within conditionals can be done, kinda JANK

```
## Modules
```
File name is the module name, access with __name__

importing module
- Does not bring the module functions into namespace, just the module

Each module has own private, but accessible namespace.

You can also directly import certain names from a module into your namespace
from fibo import a, b
- this is bad practice, dont do it!

Each module can only be imported once per interpreter session.

If you run a call python, it'll just call your module but with __name__ set to __main__.
- So you can check if code is ran like a script using 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("yo")

when import happens
1. checks for sys.builtin_module_names 
2. checks for a module.py file in sys.path

Python caches compiled version of each module into __pycache__
- these are module-version.pyc

Find out names a module defines with dir()

PACKAGES
- Lets you do A.B dotted module names, so you can write modules without giving a shit about other module definitions.
- __init__.py files are required to make python treat directories containing file as pacakges. 
- in the init, define __all__ to support `from numpy import *` to import whats necessary

SHADOWING
- Is when you import function with name that already defined.
```
## Input and Output
```
beautiful
cat = 5
print(f'debug output {cat=}')

Read files with open()
f = open("readme.txt", 'r', encoding="utf-8")
print(f.read())
f.close()

Use with statement
with open() as f:
	f.read()

f.readline()
for line in f:
	print(line)

You load and dump using json
json.dump(x,f)
x = json,load(f)
Can't serialise everything like sets.

But you can use pickle!
```

- [ ] What is pickle? <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle>


## Errors and Exceptions
```
raise NameError("yo")

rasie Error from Error1
```
## Classes
```
Namespace:
- Dictionary to map names to objects
- e.g built in names
- global names in module
- local names in function

To edit a global var
- set it as nonlocal to do assignment

Key point is that assignments just bind local names to objects
- use global and non global to signify what scope python should look at 
- nonlocal to refer to nearest enclosing scope that is not global
- global to refer to global scope

So how do classes work?
- Like functions class definitions, need to be executed!
- when class def is left a class object is created and bound to the local scope

Class objects
- can be initialised Class() or referenced class.do_something()
- `__init__(self)` is auto invoked on initialisation

Instance objects
- Calling constructor you get a instance object

Method objects
- calling x.f instead of x.f() will create a method object instead of calling it
- x.f() is equivalent to MyClass.f(x)
- if you want to call other methods, define a self as first argument and invoke self.x()
- Python automatically passes the instance as a first arg when invoking instance object methods so you need to provide a self as arg 1

Defining a list in class definition, will be shared between all instances of a class. You should define your mutable shit in init

Nothing in python allows for true data hiding!

To do inheritance just do 
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):

Generic tools
- isinstance(classa,classb)
- isubclass(classa,classb)

private instance variables do not exist
- _dont_touch = 5
- __ double underscore gets you name mangling, adds _classname__spam

Use dir(class) to view names defined on a instance object

from dataclasses import dataclass
- get struct like classes!

ITERATORS!
- iterator = iter(list)
- next(iterator) gets next value, until throwing a StopIteration

class Rev:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = len(data)
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self # you just need to return an object with a next method
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.index == 0:
            raise StopIteration
        self.index -= 1
        return self.data[self.index]

s = "abc"    
r = Rev(s)
it = iter(r)
print(next(it))
print(next(it))
print(next(it))
print(next(it))

GENERATORS!
- generators let you create iterators
- use yield statement to return data
- when next is called generator reassumes from where it left off
- tend to be more memory friendly than equivalent list comprehensions
- actually hella clean

def bong(input: str):
    yield(input)
    yield("bong")

for e in bong("bing"):
    print(e)

```
## Standard Library
```
Operating system: import os
- Higher level just use shutil, shell util

Use dir and help on modules

- glob module

CLI: sys
- argparse to get arguments
- or just argv 

Regular expressions: re

Maths: math

Stats: statistics

Internet: urllib
- from urllib.request import urlopen
- with urlopen() as response
- pretty simple, nice

Dates: datatime

Compression: zlip,gzip,bz2,lzma,zipfile,tarfile

Perf: timeit, profile, pstats

QA: doctest, unitest
- super cool

For debugging:
- repr()
- can also import reprlib
- import pprint

nice text wrapping: textwrap
localisation: locale
templating: string module

binary data: struct

threading: threading
- provides lcoks, events, semaphores

logging: logging

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
- python does ref counting for most objects and garbage collection to eliminate cycles
- Sometimes you want to keep track of this but by tracking you are creating a ref.
- So use weakref module 

to get an array
- import array, simple

to get deque
- from collections import deque

to get a heap
- import heapq

to handle floats properly use: decimal
```
## Virtual Environment and packages
```
To handle versions create virtual envs
- self contained directory tree that contains python installation for specifc python and number of additional packages

common thing to do is
python -m venv .venv
- hides venv as you're working

source .venv/bin/activate
- to active it!
- and just type deactvate to deactivate

PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
- pip installs packages
- python -m pip list
```

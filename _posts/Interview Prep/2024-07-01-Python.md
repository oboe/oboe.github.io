## Python Interpreter

- [ ] What is the python global interpreter lock?
## Basics

```
In interactive last printed expression is assigned to variable `_`

Theres no char type in python.

You ca slice with word[0:2] a->b(excluded)

strings are immutable, so you need to recreate them

use len(word) for strings

collections are called compound data types

list = [1,2,3,4]

simple assignment is by reference

print(a, end=',') to avoid newlines

```
## Control flow

```
dogs = {'bob':'corgi','jeff':'wolf'}
for key,val in dogs.copy().items():
	print("yay I'm iterating")

Your standard for loop!
for i in range(len(n)):
	print(i)

for a,b in enumerate(values):
	print(a,b)

range() looks like it creates a list but it ISNT! 
ITS AN iterable!
<https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable >

use pass to fill a unimplemented body.

DEFINING FUNCTIONS!
- executing a function adds a new symbol table for the local vars
- so all vars check the local symbol table, then the outer one, then global, then built-in ones.
- this means if you assign x=2 in a func, and a global x is defined it'll just create a new func in the function symbol table. You need to pull in the global one using `global x`
- The function parameters are actually added to the local symbol table of the called func, it's call by value!
- function definitions are also inserted in the relevant symbol table.
- functions always just return None

function defaults are only evaluated once, this accumulates values, mega JANK
def f(a,L=[]):
	L.append(a)
	return L

if you want to get arbitrary info through your python functions
- getting tuple `*arguments`
- getting dict `**keywords`

want to provide a func elements from a list? args = [1,2] then use range(*args). Same can be done with dicts.

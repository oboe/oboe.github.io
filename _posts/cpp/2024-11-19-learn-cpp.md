## Intro
Lang stack looks like
1. Machine lang, x86 or arm that only specific CPUs can understand
2. (Assembler converts ass lang into machine lang)
3. Assembly lang, human readable machine lang (also machine specific)
4. (Compiler and or interpreter)
5. High level lang

Cpp stack looks like [info](<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/translation_phases)>
1. Source file
2. (Preprocessing)
3. (Compiler)
4. object files: machine language
5. (Linker)
6. Link all these object files together into a exe or a lib
## Basics
By default `int width = 5` assignment copies the value to right side to the variable of left side, it's doing a copy-assignment. Copy initialisation has an overhead, and is used for function parameter and returns.

Can also do other initialisation syntax.
```cpp
int d { 7 };   // direct-list-initialization (initial value in braces)
int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces), set to 0

// And the crappier direct initialisation
int f (4);
// List init disallows narrowing conversions! Beautiful!
int f (4.5); // somehow allowed?
```

Maybe a little surprising is that `x = 5` and `cout << 5` are both operators and can be chained like a `+`.
## Basics: functions and files
When returning from main you need to pull in some preprocessor macros to return.
```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE

int main() {
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Compiler declarations.
- If you're defining two functions, because the compiler works sequentially line by line you need to declare functions you're going to use before you use them. Sometimes this isn't possible with cyclic definitions. You can avoid this by having a function prototype declared ahead.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int x, int y);

int main(){
    cout << add(5,6) << "\n";
    return 0;
}

int add(int x, int y){
    return x + y;
}
```

Cpp has namespaces, it was a shit show having all the function names being hogged up by stdlib functions, so these were moved to the `std::` namespace. yay!

Before compilation there is a preprocessing phase, that converts source code into translation units that are passed to the compiler.
- Processes those directives e.g `#include <iostream>` and macros `#define`.
- You can do if statements on these macro defines to choose what code gets compiled.

Header files are just files which have a bunch of forward declarations that the preprocessor will include in the file for us.
- You should have a header guard so that your header is only inlined once
- Best practice is to include the corresponding h file in the corresponding cpp file. To catch compilation errors early.

```cpp
#ifndef SQUARE_H
#define SQUARE_H

int getSquareSides()
{
    return 4;
}

#endif
```
## Debugging
Consider printing to `cerr <<` instead of `cout` as it's unbuffered so will always be emitted to out.

Consider doing linting.

## Fundamental data types
Incomplete types are types that are declared but not defined with a set amount of memory to allocate, e.g void.

Be careful with implicit conversions, especially between unsigned and signed integers!

Base ints actually have undefined bounds depending on architecture as they only have a defined min of 16 bits, this is crap, fixed in cpp11 with fixed width integers `int32_t`. But as it's not guaranteed that the smallest bounded ints are the fastest there's even types that will just choose the fastest one for you, `int_fast32_t`.

Can write stuff in scientific notation `1.2 x 10^4 = 1.2e4`.

Cpp does implicit type conversion everywhere, unsurprisingly type conversion creates new values. Implicit conversion happens on copy assignment, function parameters and returns. Brace initialisation prevents implicit type conversion. yay!

## Intro
Lang stack looks like
1. Machine lang, x86 or arm that only specific CPUs can understand
2. (Assembler converts ass lang into machine lang)
3. Assembly lang, human readable machine lang (also machine specific)
4. (Compiler and or interpreter)
5. High level lang

Cpp stack looks like
1. Source file
2. (Compiler)
3. object files: machine language
4. (Linker)
5. Link all these object files together into a exe or a lib
## Basics
By default `int width = 5` assignment copies the value to right side to the variable of left side, it's doing a copy-assignment. Copy initialisation has an overhead, and is used for function parameter and returns.

Can also do other initialisation syntax.
```cpp
int d { 7 };   // direct-list-initialization (initial value in braces)
int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces), set to 0

// And the crappier direct initialisation
int f (4);
// List init disallows narrowing conversions! Beautiful!
int f (4.5); // somehow allowed?
```

Maybe a little surprising is that `x = 5` and `cout << 5` are both operators and can be chained like a `+`.
## Basics: functions and files
When returning from main you need to pull in some preprocessor macros to return.
```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE

int main() {
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Compiler declarations.
- If you're defining two functions, because the compiler works sequentially line by line you need to declare functions you're going to use before you use them. Sometimes this isn't possible with cyclic definitions. You can avoid this by having a function prototype declared ahead.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int x, int y);

int main(){
    cout << add(5,6) << "\n";
    return 0;
}

int add(int x, int y){
    return x + y;
}
```

Cpp has namespaces, it was a shit show having all the function names being hogged up by stdlib functions, so these were moved to the `std::` namespace. yay!

## Intro

Lang stack looks like
1. Machine lang, x86 or arm that only specific CPUs can understand
2. (Assembler converts ass lang into machine lang)
3. Assembly lang, human readable machine lang (also machine specific)
4. (Compiler and or interpreter)
5. High level lang

Cpp stack looks like
1. Source file
2. (Compiler)
3. object files: machine language
4. (Linker)
5. Link all these object files together into a exe or a lib
## Basics
By default `int width = 5` assignment copies the value to right side to the variable of left side, it's doing a copy-assignment. Copy initialisation has an overhead, and is used for function parameter and returns.

Can also do other initialisation syntax.
```cpp
int d { 7 };   // direct-list-initialization (initial value in braces)
int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces), set to 0

// And the crappier direct initialisation
int f (4);
// List init disallows narrowing conversions! Beautiful!
int f (4.5); // somehow allowed?
```

Maybe a little surprising is that `x = 5` and `cout << 5` are both operators and can be chained like a `+`.

Something I think is fun to do is modelling argument as directed graphs and seeing what tangential arguments could be true.
```
Argument A:
- You are smart

Argument B:
- If you are smart, you would be rich

Argument C:
- You are not rich

So the basic idea is if you were smart, you'd be rich.
A then B

So seeing that you aren't rich, then maybe you aren't smart?
C then B then not A
```
This fun idea also bleeds into other things like why you always want to try a certain thing but haven't done yet, maybe you don't actually want to try it if you haven't tried it yet. Maybe you don't really want to do that thing if you haven't done it yet.

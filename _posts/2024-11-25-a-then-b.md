Something I think is fun to do is modelling argument as directed graphs and seeing what tangential arguments could be true.
```
Argument A:
- You are smart

Argument B:
- If you are smart, you would be rich

Argument C:
- You are not rich

So the basic idea is if you were smart, you'd be rich.
A then B

So seeing that you aren't rich, then maybe you aren't smart?
C then B then not A
```
This fun idea also bleeds into other things. Maybe the reason why you haven't read that book is because you don't actually want to. Maybe the reason why you haven't tried that cuisine is because you aren't really that interested.

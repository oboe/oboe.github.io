1. The cost of turning business logic into code has dropped to zero
2. The cost of integrating services and plumbing has dropped to zero
3. The cost of building efficient reliable secure end to end systems has dropped to zero

So whats next?

Where does that leave those who have careers built on technology?
Either:
1. the end of programming, it is no longer a craft
2. the birth of opportunity: new fields, new opportunities, new industries

The main point is that yes writing code has dropped to zero. But theres a long list of things that go into building software systems that aren't code. Weird feedback loops, human stubbornness, adversaries and good ideas. The bottleneck will simply move from code to something else.

An analysis on Kapital, the company.

They first started with a dashboarding software as a wedge, then moved into a large platform, offering loans, credit cards, expense management and other financial services.

Main product offerings being, loans, credit and debit cards and invoice management.

Problem: Tackling this issue because SME businesses are underserved by loans.

Insight: They can use the metrics from the dashboarding software to help underwrite its customers successfully. Enabling them to get a low default rate.

Mentions about the idea of cohort expansion. The idea that old cohorts don't deteriorate but actually increase spend over time.

Previously fintech companies focused on scale metrics, GTV (gross transaction volume) or TPV (total payment volume). Article highlights to focus more on operating efficiently.

Apparently dashboard product has a 100% retention to date. Kinda absurd.

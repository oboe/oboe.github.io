<https://tribecap.co/bolt-perfecting-the-checkout-experience/>

Bolt initially has two products
1. A streamlined online checkout, amazon like experience
2. chargeback protection

Wedge: the checkout experience

Then using that to move into identifying fraud, high value customers, coupon clippers, customers who can be reactivated, etc.

Interesting trend of owning an interface and them building out adjacent products from the data that wedge collects.

## Ideas
At the end of the day, writing is a way of compressing your ideas onto paper and then having someone on the other end decompress what you've written down.

So there are two core components with writing
1. The idea itself
2. How much the idea resonates with the reader

Why might your idea be novel?
- Counter intuitive
- Counter narrative
- Shock and awe
- Elegant articulations
- Make people feel seen

Why might your writing resonate with people?
- Stories
- Analogies
- Examples
- Authentic voice
### Your topic
The best place to start is to write to solve a problem. Whats the objective of the post?
- Open peoples eyes by proving the status quo wrong
- Share a solution to a problem
- Distill something overwhelming into something approachable
- Tell a suspenseful and emotional story that imparts a less
- Articulate something everyone is thinking about but no one is saying
- Identify key trends on a topic and then predict the future
- Contribute original insights to a field

And why are you motivated to write this?
- Does it get something off your chest?
- Do you want to persuade others?

### Your intro
Julian starts by writing an intro because intros help him find novel ideas.

An intro is: the min info needed to
- Introduce the breadth of the post contents so the readers can decide if its for them
- Hook readers into reading more

It's kind of a like an onboarding flow, you want to buy enough goodwill from the user and eventually fulfil their wishes as they read.

At the core of it a hook is a half told story. You raise a question and tease only part of the answer.
- Question: pose an intriguing question, but dont give the full answer
- Narrative: share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion
- Research: highlight a small portion of research findings
- Arguments: make an unexpected claim, but dont explain how its true

The purpose of a hook is to compel readers to continue reading and additionally help identify what ideas are novel and you should write about.

So lets deep dive onto a few types of hooks

#### Narrative hooks
So with these you share the beginning of a profound change in circumstances and withhold the conclusion.
#### Research hooks
With research hooks you highlight fascinating findings and only tell a portion. Try to make it clear that you are only telling a portion of the findings.
#### Argument hooks
With these present a bold claim but withhold how you arrived to this conclusion.
#### So what
The main thing is that hooks arent just questions. They need to be given enough context for them to care.
1. Give them a reason to care. **Connect** it to **meaningful** problem they face.
2. Hook readers with half on an interesting story

#### So how can you do this
An easy way to do this is by converting your questions into hooks.

#### The spine of a good intro
Often a good intro structure is
1. Establish shared context **Relatable?**
2. Surface a problem and whats at stake **What is the problem**
3. Explore the problems significance **Why should you care**
4. Tease a clever solution **What is the solution**


> I’ve been running an experiment for the last few years. Each time I catch up with a friend, I ask them to describe the moment in their life when they felt most alive.
>
> I noticed something interesting about their responses.
>
> Over 90% of them describe a travel experience. Maybe it’s the time they backpacked Europe. Or the time they went bungee jumping in Australia.

> Nearly everyone associates their most alive moment with traveling, despite the fact that we spend less than 5% of the year away from home.

### Combat skepticism
Even if you do the above its very possible your hook won't work. Here a few reasons on why
- Superficial: the reader not believing you'll share things they don't already know. Fix this by teasing original insights
- Irrelevant: the reader doesn't believe you'll cover key points they care about. Fix: list the points you'll cover
- Sloppy: Readers don't want to sift through bad slop writing. Fix: make it clear and concise.
- Implausible: Readers dont believe you'll deliver on your hooks. Fix: rely on quotes from authorities who agree with you.
- Untrustworthy: Readers don't believe you're qualified to write about this. Fix: share credentials or be open that you're learning as well.

Crunch is an API for writing MapReduce pipelines. Kinda like a Java Pig. 
#### API
Based on `PCollections` which you can union, map, filter, groupByKey, combine, etc.
- Underneath it'll call MapReduce

#### Pipeline Execution
During pipeline construction, crunch builds an execution plan, a DAG of operations on PCollections.

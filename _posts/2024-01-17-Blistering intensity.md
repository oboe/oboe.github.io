Something I've come to settle on is the importance of intensity. I think for whatever you do, be that work, hobbies or miscellaneous activities you should do it as intensely as you can. Life is fleeting so why waste it on hollow activities.

> It is not that we are given a short life but we make it short, we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. -Seneca

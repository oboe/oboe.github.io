## Options land
Options: the right to buy or sell a given asset at a fixed price on or before a specific date.
Futures: must be delivered at the fixed price. Instead options gives the buyer to choose so.

Premium: options price, split into below.
- Intrinsic value, how much he makes if he exercises. Can't be less than zero.
- Time value: usually option will be worth more than just intrinsic, this is the time value.

How does the market not let people wiggle out of options contracts?
- Buyers and sellers must have clearing firms that will fulfil any obligations
- Traders will need to deposit some margin, so clearing firm and house is happy
## Basic strategies
Ignore that there is optionality to trigger the option early, what do you think the price of the underlying will be at expiration and just calculate off that.
- Main call out being that you get the options chart, where you can choose to have unlimited potential reward and fixed guaranteed downside/risk, or the reverse.

You can visualise this stuff with expiration graphs
- x axis is underlying price
- y axis is profit
## Pricing models
Traders of underlying only need to care about the direction. Options need to care about when this directional move will happen.
- This is such a pain in the ass that some ignore this directional movement and create compound options to trade on the when a directional move will happen.

Consider
- the expected return and the carrying costs
- Carrying costs is the interest you would gain if you had the money. AKA if you bought an option how much do you need to discount the final payout by?

So basically just
1. propose probabilities of all possible prices at expiration
2. Maintain an arbitrage free underlying market
3. Calculate expected return
4. From expected return deduct carrying cost

Black-Scholes model is most widely used simple option pricing model!

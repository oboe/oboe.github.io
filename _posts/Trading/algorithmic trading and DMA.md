## Market microstructure
There are two types of markets
1. Quote driven: traders trade only with a market maker who quotes prices at which they will trade at
2. Order driven: traders can place orders on a order book that will match it automatically

The steps of trading is
1. Price formation: for quote driven markets, just the bid ask spread the market maker is willing to offer, for order driven markets its what the central limit order book says
2. Price discovery/trade execution: when buy and sell sides cross, then you've found the price and start matching these quotes
3. Cleaning and settlement: do the parties have the required assets and funds to proceed, usually done through a central counter party to make it easier

The usual flow is that less popular securities will start with OTC style dealer to client over phone communication and it'll move to electronic trading venues as the number of participants increase.

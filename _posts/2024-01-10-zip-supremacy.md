Here's why zips make everything better.
1. You can take your clothes off easier. You don't need to struggle in front of everyone as you tear off your jumper each time you enter a slightly warm room.
2. When its just slightly warmer you can just wear your jacket open. You get an entire new option you can take when its not too hot but not too cold.
3. Zippers are more durable than buttons. Buttons always wear and fall off. Do you really want to get out your sewing kit to sew them on every year? Buttons are a relic of the past.
4. You can fidget with the zipper. Sitting on the train and don't have anything to do? Look no further.
5. Zips are so great that they're even used subconsciously as a status symbol. Bankers realise the greatness of zippers and wear jackets attached with just a quarter of a zip to show off their zippers to everyone else.

Something I've come to notice when designing consumer software is that humans love seeing numbers go up.

One of the best examples of this are idle games like cookie clicker, adventure capitalist or egg inc. All carefully designed to carefully harvest as much "I am making progress" dopamine as possible.

When designing your apps you should make sure this idea is present as well. In your landing view you should have something that clearly indicates to the user that they are making progress and this number should go up when they use your app.

This idea also bleeds into other aspects of life as well. Create metrics and dashboards about things you care about and you and others will most likely optimise on these things which are measured.

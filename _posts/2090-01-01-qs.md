For Amazon Web Services (AWS) - S3 (Software Development Engineer, 2022 - Present):

Can you walk me through the architecture of the Spark cluster performance benchmarking framework you developed?
- We have a benchmarking application. That spins up and benchmarks a clusters 
- Some orchestration in step functions

What specific metrics did you use to measure the performance of the Hadoop and Iceberg S3 connectors?
- Execution time. And a p value to indicate statistical significance

How did you reduce the execution time of experiments from days to seconds? What optimizations did you implement?
- Main thing was just avoiding building distribution and doing jar replacements

Describe the process of designing and implementing one of the new S3 Object Lambda bucket metadata APIs you mentioned.


What were the main challenges in integrating S3 Object Lambda with Athena and Glue?
- So tried it out, it's a auth issue
- So made changes on our side to update our auth
- Influenced Athena side to handle this
- tada

How did you identify the root causes of the high severity tickets, and what specific changes did you implement to reduce their count?
Can you explain the infrastructure changes you made to support S3 Object Lambda in a new AWS region?
What testing strategies did you employ to ensure the reliability of the new APIs and integrations?
How did you handle backwards compatibility when introducing new features or changes to existing APIs?
What performance optimizations did you implement in the S3 Object Lambda service?

Thought process: These questions aim to delve into the technical details of Shintaro's work at AWS. They cover architecture design, performance optimization, API development, and system integration. By asking about specific challenges and implementations, we can gauge his depth of understanding and verify his direct involvement in these projects.
For Amazon Web Services (AWS) - S3 (Software Development Engineer Intern, 2021):

What were the main technical challenges in extending S3 Object Lambda support from 60 seconds to 15 minutes?
How did you design the load testing tooling to identify bottlenecks in the Lambda duration extension?
What metrics did you focus on when analyzing the performance data from your load tests?
Can you explain the architecture changes required to support longer Lambda durations?

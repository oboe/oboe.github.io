HFT CPP [[2024-06-12-cpp trivia]]
- [ ] Pros and cons of different generic patterns. Plain ol virtual inheritance, CRTP, Policy Based design
- [ ] Really basic meta programming stuff mostly utilizing type traits and template args packing/unpacking
- [ ] Basic questions on std containers, ie cache locality of vectors/arrays vs lists, how unordered_map and map ordering schemes are implemented under the hood, growth cost of vector, etc
- [ ] Object model of classes in the C++ runtime
- [ ] Naive implementations of shared ptr, unique ptr, tuples
- [ ] Smart pointers (especially unique pointers), constexpr and std::array are quite low hanging fruits.

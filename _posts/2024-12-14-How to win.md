Something I've come to appreciate is the nature of how company scale affects product design. Large companies need to make a lot of revenue so will only have products and features which help this. The opposite side of this is that they actively don't create products and features for small markets with a small payoff.

This means that for you it's much easier to win small markets than to compete with these large organisations. Aka just segment the market into a niche until your product does win!

Now I'm not too sure how your uber for large dogs with owners who are passionate in crypto startup will succeed but at least we now know that you'll at least win that market niche.

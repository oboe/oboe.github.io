This is a follow up post to my 24 apps goal post.

So to build 24 apps I need to be ruthless with the investment of my time. Here's a collection of app requirements I've settled on to help my be focused in my app ideas.

### 1. Solve an acute pain
The app must solve a clear and visible pain of the customer. This can't be the pain of tracking things or the pain of boredom. The customer wants to do X and can't without this app. That is an acute pain.
### 2. No market or execution risk, just distribution risk
With developing apps theres a few risks we need to care about:
1. Market risk: do people want to product?
2. Execution risk: can you build the product?
3. Distribution risk: can you find the people who want your product?

To avoid market risk the app must solve a known problem. People should be visibly searching for a solution for the problem.

Execution risk is much easier to resolve as building apps isn't hard.

This makes it crystal clear that the key bet being played here with the 24 apps goal is whether I can effectively learn and get distribution for these apps.
### 3. Not cross platform
Supporting both platforms is way too much surface area for a single person to support over 24 apps.
### 4. No backends
Supporting 24 backends sounds like a miserable experience.
### 5. Minimal app state
State is the enemy. All apps should reduce and avoid state as much as possible. This is also to reduce maintenance and development cost.
### 6. Support just 3 views
As a single developer I don't have the time to compete in features against multi team companies. Each app should clearly lay out what three views are essential for the core gameplay loop and to maximally focus on these at the expense of other parts of the app.
### And more...
When I learn from the failures of app I release, I'll add more requirements here!

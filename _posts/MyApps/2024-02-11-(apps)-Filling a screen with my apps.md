A goal I have is filling an entire screen on my phone with my own apps. The high level intent of this goal is "why not", another intent is that I hope that my 24th app will be of pretty good quality.

So far I've released 6 apps (+1 mac app, but it doesn't really count as I can't see it on my phone screen).

To make it somewhat interesting I want to distribute the apps i build into a variety of categories.
## Education ❌
- Languages
- Music
- Cheating at homework
- Learning vocab
- Identifying plants (plant care)
- Identifying dogs
- Identifying birds

Likely not a good fit for being one of the 24 apps as a lot of education apps are asset heavy.
## Photo & Video
- Video editing
- Photo editing
- Collage makers
- Beauty filters
- Photo editing: object erasing 🤔
- Photo editing: background editing 🤔
- Video editing: adding captions 🤔
- Short form video editors
- Social media follower analytics (Instagram, youtube ,twitch, twitter, facebook)
- Passport photo ID
- Sticker creator 🤔
- Album categoriser 🤔

Building generic full fledged video and photo editing software is way too much time however focusing on the unbundling of these editors could be interesting.

On the fence on building social media analytics tools are they hold some risk of being bonked by the social media sites.
## Health and Fitness
- Sleep apps 🤔
- Calorie trackers: Done ✅
- Period trackers
- Gym trackers: Done ✅
- Meditation trackers
- Run trackers
- Yoga trackers
- Motivation quotes
- Heart rate monitors
- Step trackers 🤔
- Fasting trackers
- Water trackers 🤔
- Meal planners
- Weight trackers: Done ✅

Similarly to photo and video theres an interesting unbundling that can be seen. Calorie trackers unbundling into fasting, protein and keto trackers.
## Business
- PDF scanner 🤔
- Call recorder
- Taxes
- Background editor
- Document form fill and signer 🤔
- Resume builder, maker, creator
- Receipt maker
- Storage saver
- Counting app (count this, very interesting app idea) 🤔
- Magnifying glass with light (another great idea) 🤔
- Audio transcription: Done ✅

Lots of great opportunity in this category. Will be interesting to try eat pdf scanner and signer market.
## Games ❌
Games are way too crowded of a market and very asset heavy.
## Productivity
- Ringtone maker
- VPNs
- Chatgipities
- Widget tools 🤔
- Screen time apps 🤔
- PDF converter 🤔
- Daily plans/ the classic to do list crap
- Auto tapper apps 🤔
- Zip openers
- Grocery shopping list 🤔
- Voice translator 🤔
- Focus timer 🤔
- Floor plan creator
- Note apps
- Ultra minimalist detox app 🤔
- QR code generator 
- Habit apps 🤔
- Teleprompters 🤔

The detox (Blank Spaces App) app is super interesting. Lot of interesting ideas or you could call them classic idea pits as the productivity category is pretty much the most meme consumer app category there is after games.
## Graphics & Design
- Art editors
- Photo object removal
- Photo background removal
- Widgets, clocks and etc
- Learn drawing with AR
- Lots of AI diffusion apps. Like making logos.
- Wallpaper apps
- Add text to photo app

Interesting thing to do would do a pencil kit 100 day drawing challenge. Everyday everyone gets the same prompt each day.
## Music ❌
- Shazam knockoffs
- Music creators
- Volume and Bass editors
- Ringtone editors
- Metronomes
- Swipefy, music discovery 🤔

Not a great fit for my skillset as I don't have the expertise to build a music creation app. 
## Utilities
- Storage cleaner
- QR code, barcode scanner 🤔
- AutoPaste fast keyboard copy and paste 🤔
- Sticker makers 🤔
- Tape measure apps
- Blue tooth device finder
- Bubble level tool 🤔

Lots of easy app ideas here, the main blocker will be differentiating enough to not be recognised as spam.
## Navigation
- Speedometer
- Parking
- GPS

I see no real option to differentiate here without building a backend or investing a lot of time to move outside of MapKit. A micro idea would be a travelling tick list for each of the cool Apple MapKit landmarks.

## Finance ❌
I don't want to deal with the risk and liability of running a finance app. So this category will have to be thrown.
## Travel ❌
- Track travelled places
- Currency converter calculator

Most ideas require a backend so this ain't an option.
## Reference
- Bible, Quran
- Coin scanner
- Sky reference
- Voice and text translator
- ID scanner
- WhatsApp chat backup 🤔
- Scrabble word checker
- Google Trends (possibly into a widget?)

Honestly this category is pretty wack. However I do love the WhatsApp parasite app. Especially because WhatsApp is so prevalent.
## Lifestyle
- Plant care 🤔
- Dog training
- Countdown widget (sevenlogics) 🤔
- Vegetable care
- Phone mirror 🤔
- Photo, video recognition for blind people 🤔

Lot of apps, lot of variance, similar to the level of productivity category. Lots of clones of the same categories.
## Weather
- Weather apps, what did you expect? 🤔

Very little space to differentiate. Always an option to just make it hella pimped out like not boring or have character like the CARROT app.
## Sports
- An app to view any sport you can imagine
- An app to help you enjoy any sport you can imagine: ski, fishing, baskelball
- Scoreboard app 🤔
- Lots of gambling apps
- Betting analytics 🤔

Only two places I could see myself building would be score boarding apps and gambling analytics apps.
## News ❌
- Why the hell are police scanner apps so prevalent in the US. This is crazy. Who needs so much police information.
- The others are all just standard news sites.

Not much to do here.
## Medical
- Pregnancy tracking
- Weed maps
- Body temperature app for fever 🤔
- Blood pressure and oxygen apps
- Volume boosting apps 🤔
- Diabetes tracking
- Live transcription app: Done ✅
- Pill reminder

Mostly tracking apps and it's difficult for me to know the real needs of people who have medical problems and rely on these medical apps.
## Social Networking
- Lots of social networks
- Widget based social network called locket, quite a cool idea.
- Instagram analytics 🤔
- Lots of making friends apps for young people
- Saving tiktok videos, instagram reels
- Reposting short form content 🤔

The only stuff I would consider here would be creating social media analytics tools. Which might be interesting. Might also just be a lot of janky web scraping.
## Newsstand ❌
- Text to speech
- Just a bunch of magazines

Nothing much to do here.
## Food & Drink ❌
- Lots of food delivery

Nothing much to do here.
## Shopping ❌
- It's just shopping stores
- reward and receipt collection programs

Nothing much to do here.
## Developer Tools ❌
- Shell clients
- Text editors
- Debugging tools

Looks like theres not much of an option to monetise.
## Books ❌
- Generic books
- Manga
- Adult books

Just a lot of book reading apps. Category is too asset heavy for what I'm trying to do. Only option would be to heavily lean on generative AI tools.

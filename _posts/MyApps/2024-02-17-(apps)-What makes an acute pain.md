After building 7 apps I've realised that all my successful apps fall into one category and all the unsuccessful ones fall into another. The successful apps all solve an acute pain and the unsuccessful ones don't. 
### What is an acute pain?
An acute pain is a problem the user has and wants to solve immediately. The solution should resolve the problem within a minute of the user using your app.
### Whats the difference between the two?
Apps don't need to solve acute pains to be widely successful. In fact the largest apps often don't solve acute pains because mass market audiences don't all have acute pains. The main point is that apps that solve acute pains are significantly easier to sell. You don't need to build reputation or a high quality experience for your users, all which matters is that you solve this pain well.

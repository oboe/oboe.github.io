Something I've been thinking about is what is pain and what is painful. As the more painful a problem is the better the app is which solves that pain.

I've settled on few pains.
### The pain of losing time
People want to save time and if you provide a solution which saves a lot of time you can charge for it easily.
- DoorDash, Uber, Google Calendar, PictureThis, Hashtag Expert

### The pain of losing out on money
People are fairly rational and therefore will try to save money.
- CardPointers, Coinbase, Robinhood

### The pain of losing health
People want to stay young and healthy.
- Noom, FitnessAI, Calm, Peloton

### The pain of boredom
People want to be entertained.
- Netflix, TikTok, Reddit, Games

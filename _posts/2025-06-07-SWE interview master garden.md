After getting a few offers, here's what I did and would do again if I needed to get a SWE job again.

The legs of the SWE interview chair are:
1. Coding
2. System design
3. Behavioural

You're going to get interviews in these areas and each company will have slight different flavours to these. My recommendation is to first do the basic prep and then focus in on companies when those interviews have been booked in. This means grepping through glassdoor for every past interview question and doing them.

On general application strategy apply to a crap ton as the more interviews you do the better you'll get, my guess is that you're pretty much guaranteed to fail your first one.
## Coding
USE PYTHON. Some interviews cough cough stripe are impossible to do in verbose languages. Python is by far the best language to concisely explain standard interview concepts, outside of heap, but what are the chances someone asks you a heap question. lmao.

The prep is simple, just do leetcode. Here's a nicely structured list of 150 questions. They will get easy as you do them.

## System Design
First learn the basic concepts then learn the structure of how you should answer them and just choose a question and spend 30 minutes just writing down in a doc all your answers for each of the sections. As you do enough questions you'll learn that all of the questions are pretty much the same, put a load balancer infront of a host with a db. Wow how simple. Then dump your structured answer into chat gpt and have it ask 10 questions on you. The llm feedback loop was extremely useful and would highly recommend.

How to answer a system design question:
- In the end I've come to the FNEHDS acronym. Functional requirements, non functional requirements, estimates, high level design, deep dives, scaling.

## Behavioural
Behavioural's are just vibe checks. Theres really only a few things you need to tell who are you and why you're the goat fit. Be interested and passionate!

Who are you:
- [ ] <https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/self-introduction/>

Why you're the goat fit:
- Lookup what they previously ask
- Lookup what their values are and have a cracking the coding interview or STAR style story for each one, simple.

## Closing
With this process the main thing to note is that your goal is to hold an auction for your time with as many companies as possible. You want to get as many offers at possible at the same time. To do this when you get one offer, let every other company know and that you want to accelerate the process with them because you love their company.

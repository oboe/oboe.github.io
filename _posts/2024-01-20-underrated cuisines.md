Something which surprised me is that currently Nigeria is the country with the 6th largest population.
```
1. India
2. China
3. United States
4. Indonesia
5. Pakistan
6. Nigeria
```
My thinking is that more people means more people who care about food and therefore their cuisine must be good. I've never had Nigerian food but I'm sure that with that many people it must be delicious! Let me know if there are any dishes that I should try!

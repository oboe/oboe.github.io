I think something which is undervalued by many people is the value of creating a lot of something to become better at it compared to trying to create good things from a few tries.

My mental model for this is that by creating things more frequently you have more chances to iterate and improve and therefore you can climb the gradient faster than simply trying to pin point the maxima with a few tries.

The key callout here is to not just churn out crap. It's to rapidly create and learn by making mistakes.

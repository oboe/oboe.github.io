A quote has surprisingly stuck with me is:

> They drove a clown car that fell into a gold mine
> -Zuck, about twitter

In my day to day life I think if I'm driving a clown car to check if I should corse correct. I think the initial framing this reflection as whether its a clown car or not helps me pin point more subtle issues which I may not call out if I was simply reflecting.

Something I've been uncomfortable about is asking for a shaved head at the barbers. I feel it's almost disrespectful to ask someone who's job is cutting hair to just shave my head. It's as if I'm asking an artist to fill in a colouring book.

Another interesting thing that I notice from this is that even between barbers I can notice a difference in hair cut quality/ craft even when I ask for such as simple hair cut, a shaved head.

Something I think is fun to do is modelling argument as directed graphs and seeing what tangential arguments could be true.
```
A:
- You are smart

B:
- You are rich

A then B:
- If you are smart, you would be rich

C (not B):
- You are not rich

So the basic idea is if you were smart, you'd be rich.
A then B

So seeing that you aren't rich, then maybe you aren't smart?
C then not B then not A
```
This fun idea can also be applied to a bunch of other ideas. Of course it's not guaranteed to be true, but its interesting just as a way to view things in a new light.

Maybe the reason why you haven't read that book is because you don't actually want to.

Maybe the reason why you haven't tried that cuisine is because you aren't really that interested.

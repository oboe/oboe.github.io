Something I've come to learn when designing apps is that people can't / don't read. The mental toil of actually reading through a paragraph is far too much for most people.

So how do people make decisions without reading? What mental shortcuts are they taking?

Mostly on vibes
- Does it look well designed?
- Do other people think its good?
- Do the initial words I've skimmed fit with my world model?
- Am I generally vibing with this app?

This idea bleeds into other areas of life. 

For example in doc writing.
- You need to make it stupid simple so that you are actually conveying what you want to say.
- You need a well crafted intro/abstract to set the scene.

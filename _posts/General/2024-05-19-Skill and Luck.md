> A large part skill is to figure out what we don't know is to identify the risk, to identify the things you haven't identified and to get an answer to them as quickly as possible. As quickly as possibly is the key. If I could move at infinite speed i could run through all the scenarios and reach the ultimate business. Luck isn't a passive thing that happens, luck is something I didn't see happening because I didn't do the work to find it, and I didn't act fast enough to bring it to me, or to resolve the challenge out of the path.

Something to deeply focus on when developing apps is what the core interaction loops is.
### What are gameplay loops?
The core heartbeat of your app. A series of actions that is repeated over and over and produces the maximum value for your users.

Gameplay loops should be short, and easy to understand.
- The shorter the loop the less friction there is for the user to complete the loop. And therefore they can use it more frequently
- The easier to understand the less friction there is for the user to complete the loop. Relying on already existing/ well understood loops helps users understand your app quicker. Don't try to reinvent the wheel here.

The key thing to consider is
- Where do your users get the most value in your apps?
- Whats the simplest way of actions for your users to get this value?

You should care about loops because it is the process by which users gain value from your app. By clearly defining the loop it helps you focus on what really is important for your users. Don't overcomplicate your app by focusing on things that don't help the core user interaction loop.

### Whats a good example?
Lets have a look at an extremely good example of this: Clash Royale from supercell.

Game play loop
1. Battle: get chests, coins, ranking, crowns
2. Open chests: get resources
3. Upgrade your units: using up your resources

The genius of this loop is that they've even embedded loot boxes (variable reward) within loot boxes (even more variable reward). Each battle randomly generates a random chest rarity and each chest randomly generates random rewards. Humans love intermittent variable reward.

But it can be significantly more simple and still be interesting. For example the Hypercasual Ketchapp games.
1. Play game: get currency
2. Buy theme/items: use currency

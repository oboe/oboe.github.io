Something you should think about when developing apps is how you want to monetise it.

Theres two main families of app monetisation: IAP and Ads.
## In App Purchases
In app purchases are usually split into four categories.
1. Out right purchase: self explanatory, the user gets full access. Usually reserved for a full game package.
2. Subscriptions: dominant strategy in non gaming apps, can be seen in popular mobile games as season passes. Great to create alignment between the user and the app.
3. Consumables: things to improve or accelerate the game. Coins, gems, boosters, those candy crush retry hammer things.
4. Non-consumables: more permanent things that alter the longer app or game experience. Loot boxes, ad removal.

## Advertisements
Ads usually come in three flavours.
1. Banner ads: the least profit
2. Interstitial ads: the middle profit
3. Video ads: the most profit
## Which one should you choose?
One of the main things to consider is that to make ads worthwhile you need scale. Another thing to consider is how painful of a problem you are solving for the user. Is this something they're willing to pay a lot for or are you just solving their temporary boredom.

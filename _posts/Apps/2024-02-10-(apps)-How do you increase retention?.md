What tactics can you employ to increase app retention?
### 1. Reward the user
Incentivise the user to stay and retain. Usually this can be simple in game currency and upgrades. Try to trigger this reward at a point during the onboarding flow.
### 2. Show objectives
Determine an objective the user can track. Show this objective in plain sight. And reward the user when they hit it.
### 3. Show progression
Make it clear with a personal best or viewing past scores to show that the user is progressing. Humans love progression.
### 4. Forecast rewards
A final idea to making users retain longer is by forecasting rewards. Make it clear that users will get more reward if they stay on your app longer. What rewards will they get if they stay? Clash Royale's chests is a great example of this!

### What is attribution
Attribution is some software integrated into your mobile apps that tell you where a user came from. Geography, device, ad campaign and networks.
### Why should I care?
These services are critical because you need to know that the money you spend on ad campaigns are paying off. And with attribution this lets you understand the effectiveness of these campaigns easier.
### What are some examples?
Theres only a few major players and therefore it's getting more expensive. ðŸ˜­

- Adjust
- Tenjin
- Branch

### Whats the cost?
The usual pricing is that you get 6 cents for the attribution of paid traffic. Main risk you're taking on here is that you're paying for installs not paid conversions.

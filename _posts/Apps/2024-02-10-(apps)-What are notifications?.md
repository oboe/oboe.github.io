### What are push notifications
Pretty self explanatory. Those annoying notifications you get on your phone can be triggered manually from a backend.
### Why should I care?
One of the main benefits of push notifications is a tool of app reengagement. Theres really only two ways you can reengage your users.
1. Email 
2. Push notifications

You can choose how you reengage your users. Maybe by offering a discount, notifying of a event?
### What are some examples?
Again, mobile developers are allergic from the backend so theres a lot of tools.
1. Intercom
2. Push Woosh
3. OneSignal
4. Firebase Cloud Messaging
5. AWS SNS

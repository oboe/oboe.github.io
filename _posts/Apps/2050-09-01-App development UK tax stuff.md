Basically until you make a non negligible amount of money don't file for a LTD. Just do a self assessment. This post talks about going through the process of a tax self assessment.
### Do you need to do one?
<https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/who-must-send-a-tax-return >
- Do you make more than Â£1000? 
- (The last tax year started on 6 April 2022 and ended on 5 April 2023.)

I'm guessing you do so you'll need to file one. ðŸ˜­
### What do you need?
1. P60
2. Income from apps. App store connect!

### 1. Telling HMRC that you'll do a self assessment
<https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment >
- You'll get a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) after you register.
1. Adding a self assessment for individuals, sole traders, partnerships or trusts

Does it need to be with a business tax account?
<https://www.gov.uk/check-additional-income-tax >
- Yup
- Add a tax to your account to get online access to a tax, duty or scheme.

### What is app analytics?
It's fairly simple: a managed solution for your app metrics. Are users using certain features, are they passing your onboarding flow, are they converting past certain screens?
### Why should I care?
Without any analytics you're pretty much flying blind. Thats crazy.
### What are some examples?
Here are the major players here:
1. Mixpanel: 20mil/month events free
2. Amplitude: 10mil/month events free
3. Firebase Analytics (Google): ðŸ¤® android
4. App Metrica (Yandex): 100mil/month events free

They all provide cool segmentation/cohort tools so you can analyse your apps better!

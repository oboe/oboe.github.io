## About
Distingushed L9 Principal Engineer at Albertsons.

I love building random things I think are cool. Surprisingly people are also willing to pay for these random things.

I've built this site for two main reasons:
1. I want to build and share stronger opinions on what the future might look like.
2. I want to write more.

Lets hope that works :)

## About the site
This is the 3rd or 4th site I've made for myself. 
All previous sites died with the design trends I liked at the time.
This site aims to be ruthlessly minimalistic so it doesn't look ugly next year. (I know that even this is following the medium/notion minimalist design trend, I can't help myself the group-think brain rot is in too deep)

## About
Distingushed L9 Principal Engineer at Albertsons, certified Agile Scrum-Grandmaster.

I love building random things I think are cool. Surprisingly people are also willing to pay for these things.

In my life there are two major themes I believe in:
1. We are extremely stupid (including myself)
2. We should make our lives better by [climbing gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)

From these themes I try to live my life with these ideas in my mind:
1. Optimising for iteration speed: I'm stupid therefore I must learn often
2. Living life with blistering intensity: I'm stupid therefore I must take large steps in my learning
3. Optimising for observability: I'm stupid therefore I must know about what the gradient looks like

## About the site
This is the 3rd or 4th site I've made for myself. 
All previous sites died with the design trends I liked at the time.
This site aims to be ruthlessly minimalistic so it doesn't look ugly next year. (I know that even this is following the medium/notion minimalist design trend, I can't help myself, the group-think brain rot is in too deep)
